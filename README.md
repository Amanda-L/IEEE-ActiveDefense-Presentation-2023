# From Prey to Predator: A Use Case for Using Active Defense to Reshape the Asymmetrical Balance in Cyber Defense
## Abstract

Cyber-security countermeasures predominantly rely on a passive approach of waiting for adversaries to trigger predefined rules. However, active defense involves actively engaging with adversaries to observe, affect, and elicit attack behaviors by providing misleading information.
This approach transforms the asymmetric nature of cybersecurity defense. We conducted simulations and analyzed the techniques used in a real-world cyber-attack based on the
MITRE ATT&CK framework. Then, based on the MITRE Engage framework, we identified potential use cases for implementing active defense as a countermeasure.

Keywordsâ€”active defense, deception, TTPs, proactive defense
